## Instructions

Cheallenge yourself to memorize cards in a grid of 16 pairs. Click on a card to
flip it over, revealing one of 8 icons. Click a second card to attempt to make a
 match. When a matching pair is revealed in one move, both cards will remain open. To win the game
 you must reveal all of the cards by correctly matching pairs.

As your number of **moves** increases, your star rating will decrease at set intervals. Beating the game in fewer moves will require concentration, memorization, and sometimes a bit of luck! Try to beat your own score by completing the game in less moves or challenge yourself to beat it in less time!

_Concentration_ is the name of the game :)
